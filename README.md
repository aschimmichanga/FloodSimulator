# FloodSimulator
Teaching people how to deal with floods via a realistic simulated experience
Inspiration
Hearing recently about flood disasters, it shatters the false sense of security we sometimes fall into. Anyone can be in these situations, and after this realization, we felt that we should have an immersive experience to prepare anyone for such dangerous conditions.

What it does
There are multiple objectives that the player must complete in a set amount of time, such as packing warm clothing, essential medication, valuables and personal papers in waterproof bags along with an emergency kit. Moving things in time to avoid health risks is also a challenge because the player is only limited to carrying 50 lbs at a time and must move between floors to move certain items to a higher level.

How we built it
We learned Unity and C# from scratch, not coming in with prior knowledge in either.

Challenges we ran into
At first, we were planning to use Virtual Reality in tandem with an Oculus Rift. However, after downloading all the software prerequisites, unfortunately our computers were too technologically limited to support the processing power needed for such an endeavor. Because of this, we lost a large chunk of valuable time, inherently leading us to an incomplete project.
